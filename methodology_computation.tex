\subsection{Computational details}\label{s:computational_details}

The results in this paper were obtained using a Python distribution called Anaconda and a collection of command line utilities known as the Climate Data Operators \citep[CDO;][]{Schulzweida2014} and netCDF operators \citep[NCO;][]{Zender2014}. In addition to the Scientific Python \citep[SciPy;][]{SciPy} software stack that comes installed by default with Anaconda, additional Python libraries known as Climate Data Analysis Tools \citep[CDAT;][]{Doutriaux2009}, iris \citep{Iris} and cartopy \citep{Cartopy} were also used. These software were all installed and run on an Ubuntu operating system.
