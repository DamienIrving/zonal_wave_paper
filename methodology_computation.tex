The current irreproducibility crisis  of the computational results reported 
Each figure presented in this paper comes with a corresponding supplementary file describing the computational steps performed in its creation. The details of the code, software, and system configuration used in those computational steps is as


In an attempt to enhance the reproducibility of the computational results presented in this paper, a series of supplementary files accompany this paper, which each describe the computational steps performed in the create of each figure.
