\subsection{Computational details}\label{s:computational_details}

The results in this paper were obtained using a Python distribution known as Anaconda (REF) and a collection of command line utilities known as the Climate Data Operators \citep[CDO;][]{Schulzweida2014} and netCDF operators \citep[NCO;][]{Zender2014}. In addition to the Scientific Python \citep[SciPy;][]{SciPy} software stack that comes installed by default with Anaconda, additional Python libraries known as the Climate Data Analysis Tools \citep[CDAT;][]{Doutriaux2009} and iris/cartopy \citep{Iris} were also used. The precise details of these various software packages is as follows:

The current irreproducibility crisis  of the computational results reported 
Each figure presented in this paper comes with a corresponding supplementary file describing the computational steps performed in its creation. The details of the code, software, and system configuration used in those computational steps is as


In an attempt to enhance the reproducibility of the computational results presented in this paper, a series of supplementary files accompany this paper, which each describe the computational steps performed in the create of each figure.
