\subsection{Computational details}\label{s:computational_details}

The results in this paper were obtained using a Python distribution known as Anaconda (REF) and a collection of command line utilities known as the Climate Data Operators \citep[CDO;][]{Schulzweida2014} and netCDF operators \citep[NCO;][]{Zender2014}. In addition to the Scientific Python \citep[SciPy;][]{SciPy} software stack that comes installed by default with Anaconda, additional Python libraries known as Climate Data Analysis Tools \citep[CDAT;][]{Doutriaux2009}, iris \citep{Iris} and cartopy \citep{Cartopy} were also used. The precise details of these various software packages is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Climate Data Operators. 1.5.3. October 2011. Max Plank Institut fur Meteorologie. Hamburg, Germany. https://code.zmaw.de/projects/cdo
\item netCDF Operators. 4.0.8. April 2011. netCDF Operators Project. http://sourceforge.net/projects/nco/

\end{itemize}


Supplementary files are provided for each figure, which outline the computational steps performed in their creation. The details of the code, software, and system configuration used in those computational steps is as follows:   
\begin{itemize}
\item Operating system: Ubuntu 12.04, 64-bit %vortex
\item Software:

The current irreproducibility crisis  of the computational results reported 
Each figure presented in this paper comes with a corresponding supplementary file describing the computational steps performed in its creation. The details of the code, software, and system configuration used in those computational steps is as


In an attempt to enhance the reproducibility of the computational results presented in this paper, a series of supplementary files accompany this paper, which each describe the computational steps performed in the create of each figure.
