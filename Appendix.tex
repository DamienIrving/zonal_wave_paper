\subsection{Zonal flow composites}\label{s:zonal_composites}

In order to consider the impact of a strongly zonal hemispheric flow on surface extremes, composites for all timesteps where the PWI was less than the 10th percentile are presented for the surface air temperature (REF), precipitation (REF) and sea ice fraction (REF).
