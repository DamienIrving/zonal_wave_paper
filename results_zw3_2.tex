Given the clear dominance of wavenumber three from around 10 to 90 days of smoothing, it is interesting to consider the merits of the planetary wave index as an alternative metric for the ZW3 pattern on monthly and seasonal timescales. A direct comparison of the planetary wave index and the ZW3 index of \citet{Raphael2004} shows a relatively high level of agreement (as evidenced by the linear regression line in Figure \ref{fig:metric_vs_zw3}), however there are some important discrepancies. In particular, the color of the dots in Figure \ref{fig:metric_vs_zw3}, which represent the phase of the wavenumber three component of the Fourier Transform, are not randomly distributed. High values  

Also spreads a great deal into the bottom right quandrant (i.e.  


%although since they never really occur in isolation, perhaps the current ZW3 index is really looking at total planetary wave activity anyway?
