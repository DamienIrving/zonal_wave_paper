\subsection{Surface extremes}

Two approaches were taken to assessing the influence of planetary wave activity on surface extremes. For the first, the composite mean of a variable of interest (surface air temperture anomaly, precipitation anomaly or sea ice fraction anomaly) was calculated for all timesteps where the PWI exceeded the 90th percentile. In other words, we first asked the question: what is the average temperature (or precipitation or sea ice fraction) anomaly when there is strong planetary wave activity? To check the robustness of these results the reverse approach was also applied, whereby the average PWI was calculated at each grid point for all timesteps where the variable of interest exceeded its 90th percentile. In other words: what is the average value of the PWI when ... FIXME

FIXME: ALso look at composites of the lowest 10 percent of days. Might not need to show results, but useful to comment that the lowest 10 percent aren't reverse of highest 10 percent.

\subsubsection{Surface air temperature}

Planetary wave activity was found be associated with large and widespread surface air temperature anomalies over and/or around much of the Antarctic continent in all seasons (Figure \ref{fig:tas_composite}). The most pronounced anomalies were seen during autumn and winter, with much warmer than average conditions over West Antarcica (due to the anomalous northerly flow) and correspondly colder than average conditions over the Weddell Sea (due to the anomalous southerly flow). Due to the seasonal migration of the quasi-stationary mean planetary wave pattern, during spring the warm anomalies were much more confined to the Antarctica Peninsula.  

With respect to East Antarctica, 

MAM and JJA heat throughout all of Antarctica. Particularly hot in West Antarctica in MAM and JJA and over the Antarctic Peninsula in SON (FIXME: talk about possible mechanisms). Also cold in southern Australia during SON that strong southerly flow.
