\subsection{Surface extremes}\label{s:surface_extremes}

In order to assess the influence of planetary wave activity on surface extremes, the composite mean of a variable of interest (i.e. the surface air temperature anomaly, precipitation anomaly or sea ice fraction anomaly) was calculated for all timesteps where the PWI exceeded its 90th percentile. In other words, we asked the question: what is the average temperature (or precipitation or sea ice fraction) anomaly when there is strong planetary wave activity? The anomalous flow associated with these composites (indicated by the 500 hPa streamfunction anomaly as opposed to the streamfunction \textit{zonal} anomaly shown earlier) has a very strong ZW3 signature. This is consistent with the results presented in Section \ref{s:spatial_characteristics}, which indicate that the distinguishing feature of days of strong meridional flow is the enhanced ZW3 component (as opposed to ZW1).  

\subsubsection{Surface air temperature}

Planetary wave activity was found be associated with large and widespread surface air temperature anomalies over and/or around much of West Antarctica during all seasons (Figure \ref{fig:tas_composite}). The most pronounced anomalies were seen during autumn and winter, with warmer than average conditions over the interior of West Antarctica (associated with the anomalous northerly flow) and correspondingly colder than average conditions over the Weddell Sea (associated with the anomalous southerly flow). Due to the aforementioned seasonal migration (and breakdown during summer) of the mean planetary wave pattern, warm anomalies were confined to the Antarctica Peninsula during spring, while summer was associated with the smallest anomalies of any season.  

With respect to the remainder of the SH, anomalously warm temperatures were widespread over East Antarctica during all seasons except summer. The largest anomalies were seen over Wilkes Land during autumn and winter, in association with the anomalous northerly flow in that region. Other features of note included anomalously cool temperatures over the Ross Sea and mainland Australia during spring.
