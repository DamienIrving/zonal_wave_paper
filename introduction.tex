\section{Introduction}\label{s:introduction}

The relationship between mid-to-upper tropospheric planetary wave activity and surface extremes in the Northern Hemisphere has received a great deal of attention in recent times, as researchers try to better understand the links between the Arctic Amplification and mid-latitude weather \citep[e.g.][]{Cohen2014,Screen2014}. While the meridional temperature gradient has not undergone such dramatic changes in the Southern Hemisphere, this flurry of research activity has served to highlight the deficits in our understanding of the link between planetary wave activity and surface extremes in the Southern Hemisphere. A few recent studies have looked at the relationship with Antarcitc sea ice extent \citep{Raphael2007,Raphael2014} and surface temperatures in West Antartica \citep{Ding2011,Ding2013} (i.e. topics that much like the Arctic Amplification have made climate change headlines in recent years), but the literature currently lacks a broad, hemispheric perspective of the relationship between planetary wave acitivity and surface extremes.

\item Explain what we do know about planetary wave activity in the SH: Major recurring patterns are ZW1, ZW3 and to a lesser extent PSA. There are some metrics and climatologies already out there for the ZW1 and ZW3 \citep{Raphael2004,Hobbs2007}.
\item Explain the sea ice and West Antarctica results
