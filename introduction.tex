\section{Introduction}\label{s:introduction}

The relationship between mid-to-upper tropospheric planetary wave activity and surface extremes in the Northern Hemisphere has received a great deal of attention in recent times, as researchers try to better understand the links between the Arctic Amplification and mid-latitude weather \citep[e.g.][]{Cohen2014,Screen2014}. While the meridional temperature gradient has not undergone such dramatic changes in the Southern Hemisphere, this flurry of research activity has highlighted the deficits in our understanding of the link between planetary wave activity and surface extremes in the Southern Hemisphere. A few recent studies have looked at the relationship with Antarcitc sea ice extent \citep{Raphael2007,Raphael2014} and surface temperatures in West Antarctica \citep{Ding2011,Ding2013} (i.e. topics that much like the Arctic Amplification have made climate change headlines in recent years), but the literature lacks a broad, hemispheric perspective of the relationship between planetary wave acitivity and surface extremes. 

In both hemispheres, large-scale topography and continent-ocean heating contrasts provide strong forcing for longitudinally asymmetric planetary scale time-mean motions. Such motions, usually referred to as stationary or planetary waves, are especially strong during winter and tend to have an equivalent barotropic stucture, meaning the wave amplitude increases with height but phase lines tend to be vertical \citep{Holton2013}. In the context of weather and climate extremes at the surface, these waves are important because they produce local regions of enhanced and diminished time-mean westerly winds, which strongly influence the development and propagation of transient weather disturbances. Persistent (or blocked) weather patterns, for instance, are typically concomitant with high-amplitude waves in the upper troposphere \citep[e.g.][]{Trenberth1985,Renwick2005}.

It was \citet{vanLoon1972} who first characterised planetary wave activity in the Southern Hemisphere as the super-position of two zonally-oriented, quasi-stationary waveforms; one that repeats itself once around the hemisphere (zonal wave 1, ZW1) and another that repeats itself three times (zonal wave three, ZW3). In any Fourier decomposition of the mid-to-upper tropospheric circulation, \citet{vanLoon1972} concluded that waveforms corresponding to other wavenumbers typically only exist to modulate ZW1 and ZW3. Since that landmark study, the ZW1 and ZW3 patterns have been identified as dominant features of the mid-latitude circulation on daily (e.g., Kidson, 1988), seasonal (Mo and White,1985) and interannual (e.g., Karoly, 1989) timescales, and corresponding metrics and climatologies have been developed \citep{Raphael2004,Hobbs2007}.

FIXME: While these climatologies are great, they don't look at the influence of the waves on surface extremes (except for some sea ice work). In addtion, looking at the ZW1 and ZW3 as sepeare entities fails to acknowledge that they never really occur in isolation. This study will take a wholistic apporach (i.e. consider total planetary wave activity, including both ZW1 and ZW3 together) and will look at temperature (and perhaps rainfall) extremes.
