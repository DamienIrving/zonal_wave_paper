Elements of the mixed ZW1 / ZW3 pattern shown in Figure \ref{fig:pwi_spatial_summary} are not unique to days where the PWI is greater than its 90th percentile. As demonstrated in Figure \ref{fig:periodograms} (left panel), the ZW1 component of the flow is relatively insensitive to changes in the strength of the meridional flow. Instead, it appears that the main difference between days of very strong (PWI > 90th pctl) and very weak (PWI < 10th pctl) meridional flow is the prominence of the ZW3 component. While influential at all times, the ZW3 component is far more prominent when the meridional flow is strong and therefore dominates the streamfunction anomaly patterns (and thus surface impacts) discussed in Section \ref{s:surface_extremes}.
