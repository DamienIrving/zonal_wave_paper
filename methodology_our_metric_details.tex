\subsection{A new metric: details}

In using the Hilbert Transform to define a metric of zonal planetary wave activity, a number of methodological decisions were required. 

Which variable - geopotential height or meridonal wind?

Which wavenumbers - use all of them (as Fig 2 shows, you get the cancellation effect)
