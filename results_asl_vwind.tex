\subsubsection{Amundsen Sea Low}

\textit{ADDME? Analysis of the Amundsen Sea Low Index \citep{Turner2013} shows that the ASL is slightly deeper when the PWI > 90th percentile (975.6 hPa vs. 976.2 hPa, $p = 0.003$) and located farther to the west (224.9$^{\circ}$E vs. 233.4$^{\circ}$E, $p = 8.4e^{-17}$). There's no difference in latitude.  In need to check the seasonal results, because the ASL is deepest and farthest west during winter, which is when planetary wave activity is most common.}
