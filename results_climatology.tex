\subsection{Mean characteristics}

In order to consider the climatological characteristics of Southern Hemipshere planetary wave activity, the 90th percentile of our metric was used as a threshold. Composites of the days (with 30-day running mean applied) above that threshold show a pronounced ZW1 and ZW3 signature (Figure \ref{fig:envelope_climatology}). The composite mean wave envelope values tend to be slightly larger in the winter months, and the frequency of strong planetary wave activity is also far more pronounced during this time (Figure \ref{fig:annual_distribution}).


In the annual composite there are strong wave envelope maxima (i.e locations where the flow gets strongly meridional) over the Amundsen Sea and to the south of Australia, however it is interesting to note that the Amundsen Sea maxima is absent during summer.
