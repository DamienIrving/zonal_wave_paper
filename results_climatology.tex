\subsection{Mean characteristics}

In order to consider the climatological characteristics of Southern Hemipshere planetary wave activity, the 90th percentile of our metric was used as a threshold. Composites of the days above that threshold (i.e. corresponding to strong planetary wave activity) show a pronounced ZW1 and ZW3 signature.
