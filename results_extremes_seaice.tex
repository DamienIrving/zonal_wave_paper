\subsubsection{Sea ice}

In general, the sea ice composites (Figure \ref{fig:sic_composite}) were highly consistent with the temperature composites: 
\begin{itemize}
\item In autumn and winter, the onshore flow and anomalous warmth over the interior of West Antarctica was consistent with the reduced sea ice concentration over the Amundsen Sea. 
\item In autumn, the offshore flow and anomalous cold over the Weddell Sea was consistent with the increased sea ice concentration. 
\item In spring, the warmth over the western aspect of the Antarctic Peninsula was consistent with the reduced sea ice concentration in the Bellingshausen Sea, while the anomalously cold temperatures over the Ross Sea coincided with an anomalously high sea ice concentration.
\item The onshore winds and anomalous heat over Wilkes Land was consistent with the reduced sea ice immediately to the north of George V Land, Ad{\'e}lie Land and the Sabrina Coast of East Antarctica in all seasons except summer (when there is very little ice there anyway).
\end{itemize}

The main discrepancy was the anomalously high sea ice concentration to the west of the Antarctic Peninsula during autumn, which was not reflected in the corresponding temperature composite.
