\subsubsection{Sea ice}

FIXME: The sea ice results have a lot of similarities with the temperature results:
\begin{itemize}
\item MAM: The onshore flow that made it warm in West Antarctic matches with the reduced sea ice over the Amundsen Sea. The offshore flow that made it cold over the Weddell Sea matches with the increased sea ice.
\item JJA: The onshore flow that made it warm in West Antarctic matches with the reduced sea ice over the Amundsen Sea. The offshore flow that made it cold over the Weddell Sea doesn't match with the average sea ice.
\item SON: Warm over the Peninsula (particularly west) - low sea ice matches. Cold over the Ross Sea, more sea ice matches.
\item The onshore winds that made it hot over Wilkes Land match with the reduced sea ice in that region in all seasons except summer (when there really is no sea ice there)
\end{itemize}

The main discepancy is that the increased sea ice to the west of the Antarctic Peninsula during MAM is not really seen in the temperature maps.
