\section{Discussion}

The discussion will contain a recap of the methodology, followed by a discussion of my results as they relate to the literature:
\begin{itemize}
\item General climatological characteristics
\begin{itemize}
\item Alternative view of Hobbs (mention summer breakdown)
\item Not strongly linked to SAM or ENSO
\item Wave 1 is dominant if you look at geopotential height (as previous authors have), but wave 3 is for the meridional wind.
\end{itemize}
\item Sea ice (contrast with Raphael)
\item Rainfall reductions for mountainous regions in Southern Hemisphere
\item Cold and wet in southern/eastern Australia during spring
\item Temperatures elsewhere in Antarctica
\item Future work disentangling PSA and West Antarctic trends
\end{itemize}
