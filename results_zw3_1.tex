\subsection{An alternative ZW3 index?}

The dominance of the ZW1 and ZW3 patterns on Southern Hemisphere planetary wave activity is further emphasized when considering the individual Fourier components calculated during the Hilbert Transform. Wavenumber three dominates the average periodogram when the running mean applied to the daily 500 hPa meridional wind data is greater than 10 days, with wavenumber one becoming progressively more influential as the smoothing increases (Figure \ref{fig:fourier_spectrum}).
