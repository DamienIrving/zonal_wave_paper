\subsection{Analysis techniques}

Annual and seasonal mean composites are presented throughout the paper for key variables of interest, whereby a mean spatial map is calculated for all the timesteps that (a) fall within the season of interest, and (b) also exceed a specified threshold value. To determine the statistical significance of the composite mean at each grid point,
