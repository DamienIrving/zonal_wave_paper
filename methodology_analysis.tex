\subsection{Analysis techniques}

\subsubsection{Anomalies}
All anomaly data discussed in the paper represents the daily anomaly. For instance, to calculate the 30-day running mean surface air temperature anomaly data, a 30-day running mean was applied to the surface air temperature data and then the anomaly at each timestep was calculated by subtracting the mean value for that specific day over the entire study period.

\subsubsection{Composites}
Annual and seasonal mean composites are presented throughout the paper for key variables of interest. To produce these composites, a mean spatial map was calculated across all timesteps that (a) fell within the season of interest, and (b) exceeded a specified threshold value. To determine the statistical significance of the composite mean at each grid point, two-sided, independent sample t-tests were used to calculate the probability ($p$) that the composite mean value was equal to the climatological (i.e. all timesteps) mean for that season.

\subsubsection{Normalisation}
In order to aid visual comparisons, the "normalised" values of a given index are presented on a number of occasions throughout the paper. The normalisation process involves subtracting the mean of the data series and then dividing by the standard deviation.

%\subsubsection{Periodograms} %From Wilks2011
%The characterisitcs of data series that have been Fourier-transformed are most often examined graphically, using a plot known as a periodogram, or Fourier line spectrum. This plot is sometimes called the power spectrum, density spectrum, or simply the spectrum, of the data series. In it's simpliest form, the plot of a spectrum consists of the squared amplitudes $C_k^2$ as a function of the frequencies $\omega_k$. Therefore, the spectrum conveys the proportion of variation in the orginal data series accounted for by oscillations at the harmonic frequencies, but does not supply information about when in time these oscillations are expressed.

%The vertical axis of a plotted spectrum is sometimes numerically rescaled. One choice is the $R^2$ statistic commonly computed in regression; the $R^2$ for the $k$th harmonic is simply:

%\begin{equation}
%R_k^2 = \frac{(n/2)C_k^2}{(n-1)s_y^2}
%\end{equation}

%where $s_y^2$ is the sample variance of the data series, $n$ the length of the data series, $k$ and $C_k^2$ the squared amplitude for that harmonic. The statistic tells you the proportion of variance in the original data series accounted for by that harmonic.
