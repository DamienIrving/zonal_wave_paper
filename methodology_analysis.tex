\subsection{Analysis techniques}

Annual and seasonal mean composites are presented throughout the paper for key variables of interest. To produce these composites, a mean spatial map was calculated across all timesteps that (a) fell within the season of interest, and (b) exceeded a specified threshold value. To determine the statistical significance of the composite mean at each grid point, two-sided, independent sample t-tests were used to calculate the probability that the composite mean value was equal to the climatological (i.e. all timesteps) mean for that season.
