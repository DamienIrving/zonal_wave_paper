\section{Results}

Our results begin with a summary of the spatial and temporal characteristics of SH planetary wave activity, before considering its relationship with both the major modes of SH climate variability (SAM and ENSO) and surface extremes. 

\subsection{Spatial characteristics}\label{s:spatial_characteristics}

Visual inspection of the SH circulation revealed that days (with 30-day running mean applied) of PWI greater than the 90th percentile overwhelming exhibited a mixed ZW1 / ZW3 hemispheric planetary wave pattern (Figure \ref{fig:pwi_spatial_summary}). Days of PWI less than the 90th percentile become increasingly unlikely to exhibit a coordinated hemispheric wave pattern, so the 90th percentile was taken as a threshold value for planetary wave activity.
