\label{fig:example_hilbert}
Hilbert Transform of the 30-day running mean, 500 hPa meridional wind for 22 May 1986 and 29 July 2006 at 54.75$^{\circ}$South. The original meridional wind (solid green), individual Fourier components for wavenumbers 1-9 (grey dashed), reconstructed signal (i.e. twice the sum of the individual components; dashed orange), and wave envelope (which is the end product of the Hilbert Transform; solid orange) are all shown. 
% Might want to note that the amplitude of everything in this plot (expect the original data) has been multiplied by two so that the negative wavenumber components didn't have to be included.
