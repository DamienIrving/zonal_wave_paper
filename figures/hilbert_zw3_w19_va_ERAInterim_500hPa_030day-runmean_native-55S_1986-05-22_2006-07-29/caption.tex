Hilbert Transform (for wavenumbers 1-9) of the 30-day running mean, 500 hPa meridional wind for 22 May 1986 and 29 July 2006 at 54.75$^{\circ}$South. The original meridional wind (solid green), individual Fourier components for wavenumbers 1-9 (grey dashed), reconstructed signal from the inverse Fourier Transform (dashed orange), and wave envelope (which is the end product of the Hilbert Transform; solid orange) are all shown. Note that the amplitude of all the curves (except the original data) have been multiplied by two, to account for the fact that the corresponding (and identical) negative wavenumbers (i.e. wavenumers -9 to -1) we not included in the Hilbert Transform.
