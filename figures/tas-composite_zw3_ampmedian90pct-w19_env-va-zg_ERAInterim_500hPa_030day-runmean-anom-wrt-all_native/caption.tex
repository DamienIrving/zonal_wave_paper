\label{fig:tas_composite}
Composite mean surface air temperature anomaly for days (with 30-day running mean applied) where the planetary wave index is greater than its 90th percentile. Black contours show the corresponding composite mean zonal geopotential height anomaly, while the hatching shows regions where the difference between the composite mean and climatological mean is significant at the $p < 0.01$ level.  

% negative geopotential height anomalies indicate a clockwise rotation (as viewed from the south pole)
