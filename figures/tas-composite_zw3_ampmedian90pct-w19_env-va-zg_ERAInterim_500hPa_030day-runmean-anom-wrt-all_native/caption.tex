\label{fig:tas_composite}
Composite mean surface air temperature anomaly for days (with 30-day running mean applied) where the PWI was greater than its 90th percentile. Black contours show the corresponding composite mean zonal 500 hPa geopotential height anomaly (dashed contours indicate negative values), while the hatching shows regions where the difference between the composite mean and climatological mean is significant at the $p < 0.01$ level.
