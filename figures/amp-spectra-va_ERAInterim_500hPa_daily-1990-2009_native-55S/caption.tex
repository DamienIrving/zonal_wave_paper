\label{fig:fourier_spectrum}
Average amplitude spectrum at 54.75$^{\circ}$S for the period 1990-2009. In order to calculate the average amplitude for each wavenumber (or frequency), a Fourier Transform of the 500 hPa meridional wind was performed at each timestep along the 54.75$^{\circ}$S latitude circle. The figure legend indicates the running mean (in days) applied to the daily data prior to the Fourier Transform. DESCRIBE THE NORMALISATION PROCEDURE AND REMOVE THE HEADER.
