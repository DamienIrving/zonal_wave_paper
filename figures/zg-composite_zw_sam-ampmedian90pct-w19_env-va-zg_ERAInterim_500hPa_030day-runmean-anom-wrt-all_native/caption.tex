\label{fig:sam_composite}
Composite mean zonal 500 hPa streamfunction anomaly for days (with 30-day running mean applied) where the PWI is greater than its 90th percentile and the AOI is greater than its 75th percentile (red) or less than its 25th percentile (blue). The gray contours indicate the anomaly for all timesteps, dashed contours indicate negative values and the contour interval is $2.5 \times 10^6 \: m^2 s^{-1}$.
