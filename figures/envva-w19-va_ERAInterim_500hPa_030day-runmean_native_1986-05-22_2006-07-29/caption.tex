\label{fig:example_envelope}
Wave envelope (calculated from the 30-day running mean meridional wind) for 22 May 1986 and 29 July 2006. The black contours show the corresponding zonal anomaly of the geopotential height (contour interval is 60m, dashed contours denote negative values). Wavenumbers 1-9 were retained in the Hilbert Transform, and the 54.75$^{\circ}$South latitude band is shown for ease of comparison with Figure X.
