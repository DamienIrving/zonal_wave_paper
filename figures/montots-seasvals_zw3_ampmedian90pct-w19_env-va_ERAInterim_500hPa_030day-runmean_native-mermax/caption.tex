\label{fig:annual_distribution}
Distribution of days (with 30-day running mean applied) where the PWI was greater than its 90th percentile. Monthly totals for the entire study period (1979-2014) are shown in panel (a), while the total days for each individual season are shown in panel (b). To account for the fact that not all months have an equal number of days, the counts for each month (panel a) are presented as a percentage of the total number of days for that month. Years in panel (b) are defined from December to November (e.g. the `year' 1980 spans December 1979 to November 1980).
