\label{fig:annual_distribution}
Distribution of days (with 30-day running mean applied) where the Planetary Wave Index is greater than its 90th percentile. Monthly totals for the entire study period (1979-2014) are shown on the left, while the total days for each season are shown on the right. To account for the fact that not all months have an equal number of days, the counts for each month (left) are presented as a percentage of the total number of days for that month. The annual totals (right) have been divided by four for ease of comparison with the individual seasons.
