\label{fig:pwi_spatial_summary}
Composite mean 500 hPa circulation for days (with 30-day running mean applied) where the PWI was greater than its 90th percentile. Streamline colors indicate the wind speed (weakest speeds in yellow, strongest in dark blue) while the gray contours show the composite mean streamfunction zonal anomaly (dashed contours indicate negative values and the contour interval is $2.5 \times 10^6 \: m^2 s^{-1}$).
