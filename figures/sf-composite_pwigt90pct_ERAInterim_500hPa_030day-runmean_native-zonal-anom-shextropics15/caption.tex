\label{fig:pwi_spatial_summary}
Composite mean 500 hPa circulation for days (with 30-day running mean applied) where the PWI is greater than its 90th percentile. Streamline colors indicate the wind speed (weakest speeds in yellow, strongest in dark blue) while the gray contours show the composite mean streamfunction anomaly (dashed contours indicate negative values).
