\label{fig:sic_composite}
Composite mean sea ice concentration anomaly for days (with 30-day running mean applied) where the PWI was greater than its 90th percentile. Black contours show the corresponding composite mean 500 hPa streamfunction anomaly (dashed contours indicate negative values and the contour interval is $2.5 \times 10^6 \: m^2 s^{-1}$), while the hatching shows regions where the difference between the composite mean and climatological mean is significant at the $p < 0.01$ level.
