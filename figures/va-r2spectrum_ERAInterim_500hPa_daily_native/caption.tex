\label{fig:fourier_spectrum}
Average periodogram at 54.75$^{\circ}$S over the entire study period (1979-2014). The legend indicates the running mean (in days) applied to the daily 500 hPa meridional wind data prior to the Fourier Transform. 

FIXME: For consistency with previous terminology, I might want to include $R^2$ in brackets on the y-axis label and the word wavenumber and/or harmonic on the x-axis label.

FIXME: Create this periodogram for the first and last half of the study period to see if the ZW1/ZW3 ratio has changed over time.
