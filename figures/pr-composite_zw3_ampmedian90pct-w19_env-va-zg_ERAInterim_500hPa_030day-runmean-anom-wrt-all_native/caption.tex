\label{fig:pr_composite}
Composite mean precipitation anomaly for days (with 30-day running mean applied) where the PWI is greater than its 90th percentile. Black contours show the corresponding composite mean 500 hPa streamfunction anomaly (dashed contours indicate negative values), while the hatching shows regions where the difference between the composite mean and climatological mean is significant at the $p < 0.01$ level.
