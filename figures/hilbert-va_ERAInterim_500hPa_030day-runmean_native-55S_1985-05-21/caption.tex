Hilbert Transform of the 30-day running mean meridional wind for 22 May 1986 and 29 July 2006 at 54.75$^{\circ}$South. The original meridional wind data (solid green), individual Fourier components for wavenumbers 1-9 (grey dashed), reconstructed signal (i.e. the sum of the individual components; solid orange), and wave envelope (which is the end product of the Hilbert Transform; dashed orange) are all shown.
