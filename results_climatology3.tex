The composite mean wave pattern (Figure \ref{fig:pwi_spatial_summary}) has a slightly larger amplitude during the winter months and the frequency of strong planetary wave activity is also far more pronounced at that time of the year (Figure \ref{fig:annual_distribution}). The are no statistically significant linear trends in planetary wave activity for any season, however 1980 was associated with particularly strong wave activity (\textit{FIXME: Look into 1980 in detail}).
