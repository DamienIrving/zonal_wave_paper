\section{Data}\label{s:data}

The series of reliable, spatially complete atmospheric data available for the mid-to-high southern latitudes is relatively short. The reanalysis projects have produced sequences of surface and upper air fields that in some cases date back to the 1950s \citep{Kistler2001,Uppala2005,Kobayashi2015}, however it is generally accepted that these have limited value prior to 1979 at high southern latitudes, due to a lack of satellite sounder data for use in the assimilation process \citep{Hines2000}.

The latest generation reanalysis datasets (which all date back to at least 1979) are the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Interim Reanalysis dataset \citep[ERA-Interim;][]{Dee2011}, Modern Era Retrospective-analysis for Research and Applications \citep[Merra;][]{Rienecker2011}, Climate Forecast System Reanalysis \citep[CFSR;][]{Saha2010} and Japanese 55-year reanalysis \citep[JRA-55;][]{Kobayashi2015}. 

A recent validation study of the latest global reanalysis products showed that the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Interim Reanalysis dataset (ERA-Interim) best reproduces the mean sea level pressure and 500-hPa geopotential height at station locations around Antarctica \citep{Bracegirdle2012}.
