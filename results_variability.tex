\subsection{Variability}

FIXME: Look at the spectral density for a number of timescales. Mention that (on a 30-day running mean timescale) there's no relationship between the planetary wave index and the SAM index of \citet{Marshall2003} or the Nino 3.4 index of \citet{Trenberth2001} (not shown). The periodogram for the planetary wave index (not shown) shows an strong annual peak but no other pronounced features.
