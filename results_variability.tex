\subsection{Variability}

A basic analysis of the variability of the PWI (on the 30-day running mean timescale) showed no relationship between it and the major indices of Southern Hemisphere variability. In particular, linear regression analysis (not shown) showed no relationship with the Southern Annual Mode index of \citet{Marshall2003} or the Ni\~{n}o 3.4 index of \citet{Trenberth2001}. The periodogram for the PWI (not shown) showed a strong annual peak (corresponding to the high winter activity) but no other pronounced features.

HELP IAN: A number of studies \citep[e.g.][]{Trenberth1980,Raphael2003,Hobbs2007} have found significant links between ZW1 and ENSO, while \citet{Pezza2012} suggest that stationary wave activity is linked to both ENSO and the SAM (particularly when they are in phase). I wonder if perhaps we should look a little more closely at this?
