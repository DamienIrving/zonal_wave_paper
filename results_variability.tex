\subsection{SAM and ENSO}

Composite analysis was also used to assess the relationship between the PWI and the major modes of SH climate variability. Positive (El Ni\~{n}o) and negative (La Ni\~{n}a) ENSO events were defined as a Ni\~{n}o 3.4 above 0.5$^{\circ}$C and below -0.5$^{\circ}$C respectively, while SAM events were defined according to the 75th and 25th percentiles of the AOI. Composites for each phase of SAM and ENSO were then calculated by taking the average across all data times for which the PWI exceeded its 90th percentile \textit{and} the Ni\~{n}o 3.4 or AOI index was greater or less than the relevant threshold. 

The SAM composites show that the phase of the planetary wave pattern moves east during positive SAM events and west during negative (Figure \ref{fig:sam_composite}). Planetary wave activity was also more common when the SAM was negative: of the 1312 data times where the PWI exceeded its 90th percentile, 510 (39\%) had an AOI value that was less than the 25th percentile as compared to only 166 (13\%) with an AOI greater than the 75th percentile. The aforementioned standout year for planetary wave activity (1980; see Figure \ref{fig:annual_distribution}b) was associated with a large negative SAM, however other years of high or low planetary wave activity had an inconsistent relationship with the SAM.

The association between ENSO and planetary wave activity was far less pronounced. Besides a subtle east (La Ni\~{n}a) / west (El Ni\~{n}o) movement of the anticyclone over the south-east Pacific, no appreciable changes were seen in the phase of the planetary wave pattern (not shown) and planetary wave activity was only slightly more common during El Ni\~{n}o conditions (282 data times to 176).
