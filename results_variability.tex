\subsection{Variability}

A basic analysis of the variability of the PWI (on the 30-day running mean timescale) showed no relationship between it and the major indices of Southern Hemisphere variability. In particular, linear regression analysis showed no relationship with the Southern Annual Mode index of \citet{Marshall2003} or the Ni\~{n}o 3.4 index of \citet{Trenberth2001} (not shown). The periodogram for the Planetary Wave Index (not shown) showed a strong annual peak (corresponding to the high winter activity) but no other pronounced features.
