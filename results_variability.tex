\subsection{Variability}

A similar composite analysis was used to assess the relationship between the PWI and the major modes of SH climate variability. Positive (El Ni\~{n}o) and negative (La Ni\~{n}a) ENSO events were defined as a Ni\~{n}o 3.4 above 0.5$^{\circ}$C and below -0.5$^{\circ}$C respectively, while SAM events were defined according to the 75th and 25th percentiles of the AOI. Composites for each phase of SAM and ENSO were then calculated by taking the average across all timesteps for which the Ni\~{n}o 3.4 or AOI index was greater or less than the relevant threshold \textit{and} the PWI exceeded the 90th percentile. 

The circulation anomalies associated with the SAM composites show that the phase of the zonal planetary wave pattern moves east during positive SAM events and west during negative (Figure \ref{fig:sam_composites}. Planetary wave activity was also more common when the SAM was negative; of the 1291 timesteps where the PWI exceeded the 90th percentile, 499 (39\%) had an AOI value that was less than the 25th percentile as compared to only 168 (13\%) with an AOI greater than the 75th percentile.
