\subsection{A new metric}

Our solution to this problem borrows from recent advances in the automated identification of Rossby wave packets. In particular, \citet{Zimin2003} pioneered a method of identifying the envelope of waveforms in the atmosphere based on the Hilbert Transform, which is a well known technique in digital signal processing but was previously untried in the atmospheric sciences. The method involves performing a Fourier transform, followed by an inverse Fourier transform just for the wavenumbers of interest. The (complex) amplitude of the resulting waveform represents the wave envelope (FIG 1). Subsequent studies have gone on to apply this method in the context of identifying and tracking Rossby wave packets in daily timescale data \citep{Glatt2014,Souders2014a}, however its utility in identifying waveforms on larger temporal and spatial spaces has not previously been investigated.

In the context of planetary wave activity in the Southern Hemisphere, the wave amplitude essentailly represents an agregated measure of...
