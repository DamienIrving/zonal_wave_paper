\subsection{A new metric}

Our solution to this problem borrows from recent advances in the automated identification of Rossby Wave Packets. In particular, \citet{Zimin2003} pioneered a method of identifying the envelope of waveforms in the atmosphere based on the Hilbert Transform, which is a well known technique in digital signal processing but was previously untried in the atmospheric sciences. The method involves conducting a Fourier transform of the data, followed by an inverse Fourier transform for the wavenumbers of interest. The (complex) amplitude of the resulting waveform represents the wave envelope (FIG 1).
