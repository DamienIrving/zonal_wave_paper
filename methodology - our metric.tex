\subsection{A new metric}

Our solution to this problem borrows from recent advances in the automated identification of Rossby Wave Packets. In particular, \citet{Zimin2003} pioneered a method of identifying the envelope of waveforms in the atmosphere (FIG 1) based on the Hilbert Transform, which was a well known technique in digital signal processing but previously untried in the atmospheric sciences.
