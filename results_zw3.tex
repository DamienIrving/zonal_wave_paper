\subsection{An alternative ZW3 index}

The dominace of the ZW1 and ZW3 on Southern Hemisphere planetary wave activity is further emphasised when considering the individual Fourier components calculated during the Hilbert Transform (Figure \ref{fig:fourier_spectrum}).


Show that at 30 day running mean timescale, ZW3 is dominant and could be a good alternative metric, although since they never really occur in isolation, perhaps the current ZW3 index is really looking at total planetary wave activity anyway?
