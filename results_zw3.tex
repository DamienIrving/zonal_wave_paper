\subsection{An alternative ZW3 index}

The dominace of the ZW1 and ZW3 patterns on Southern Hemisphere planetary wave activity is further emphasised when considering the individual Fourier components calculated during the Hilbert Transform (Figure \ref{fig:fourier_spectrum}). When no temporal smoothing is applied to the daily timescale 500 hPa meridional wind data, wave number four is most dominant. For smoothing of around 10 days and longer wave three is clearly dominant, with wave one becoming progressively more influential as the smoothing increases.




Show that at 30 day running mean timescale, ZW3 is dominant and could be a good alternative metric, although since they never really occur in isolation, perhaps the current ZW3 index is really looking at total planetary wave activity anyway?
