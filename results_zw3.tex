\subsection{An alternative ZW3 index?}

The dominace of the ZW1 and ZW3 patterns on Southern Hemisphere planetary wave activity is further emphasised when considering the individual Fourier components calculated during the Hilbert Transform. Wavenumber three dominates the wavenumber spectrum for running means greater than 10 days, with wavenumber one becoming progressively more influential as the smoothing increases (Figure \ref{fig:fourier_spectrum}).

Given the clear dominance of wavenumber three from around 10 to 90 days, it is interesting to consider the merits of our planetary wave metric as an alternative metric for the ZW3 pattern itself on monthly and seasonal timescales.  


%although since they never really occur in isolation, perhaps the current ZW3 index is really looking at total planetary wave activity anyway?
