Mid-to-upper tropospheric planetary wave activity in the Southern Hemisphere is characterised by the superposition of two zonally-oriented, quasi-stationary waveforms; one that repeats itself once around the hemisphere (zonal wave one; ZW1) and another that repeats itself three times (zonal wave three; ZW3). Previous studies have tended to consider these waveforms in isolation and (besides sea-ice) little is known about their impact on surface extremes. 

Borrowing from recent advances in the automated identification of Rossby wave packets, this study defines a new metric of total (i.e. ZW1 and ZW3) planetary wave activity.
