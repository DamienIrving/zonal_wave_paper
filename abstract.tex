Southern Hemisphere mid-to-upper tropospheric planetary wave activity is characterised by the superposition of two zonally-oriented, quasi-stationary waveforms; one that repeats itself once around the hemisphere (zonal wave one; ZW1) and another that repeats itself three times (zonal wave three; ZW3). Previous studies have tended to consider these waveforms in isolation and with the exception of sea-ice, little is known about their impact on surface extremes. 

Borrowing from recent advances in the automated identification of Rossby wave packets, this study makes use of a signal processing technique known as a Hilbert Transform to define a new metric of total zonal wave activity. It captures both the ZW1 and ZW3 patterns and improves on existing metrics by allowing for variations in both wave phase and amplitude.

Composites of the mean surface conditions for months of strong planetary wave activity reveal highly anomalous sea ice concentrations over the Amundsen/Bellingshausen Seas during autumn and along much of the East Antarctic coastline throughout most of the year. Strong planetary wave activity is also associated with highly anomalous precipitation in regions where orographic precipitation dominates (e.g. New Zealand, Chile, coastal Antarctica), wet and cool conditions over eastern and southern Australia during spring and anomalously warm temperatures over much of the Antarctic continent. The latter has potentially important implications for the interpretation of recent warming over West Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula.
